Does it mean something?","Quest.bear_6.step2":"It means that we're very close to a great discovery!","Quest.candies_4.step1":"Looks like I'm hungry again... These pumpkins seem pretty tasty to me.","Quest.candies_4.step2":"They are all yours. But don't expect me to cook for you. My heart belongs to chopping!","Quest.wood_9.step1":"Looks like we've finally found it! Is this place big enough for you?","Quest.wood_9.step2":"For me? It can fit a whole squadron. Now we just have to find one.","Quest.wood_9.step3":"Before we do, let's finish the construction. What do you need to do that?","Quest.wood_9.step4":"I need to sharpen my ax and find myself some ents.","Quest.wood_9.step5":"And I need to eat something. Sounds like a great plan!","Quest.stone_1.step1":"I was looking for some food but this is what I've found.","Quest.stone_1.step2":"I'll do my best to keep you full but in the meantime keep looking for more stone so we could build a fort.","Quest.stone_2.step1":"I already know that you're good with wood but how about other materials?","Quest.stone_2.step2":"I can build anything out of everything. Watch and learn!","Quest.stone_3.step1":"This is what you call erecting a building? Can't you do anything without my help?","Quest.stone_3.step2":"Don't you like it? I was kind of thinking that it was perfect for you.","Quest.stone_3.step3":"If we have to rebuild our Kingdom from scratch I'll make sure that I have the biggest palace.","Quest.stone_4.step1":"I can't believe that I'm saying this but you were actually right. It is prefect for me. I'll use it as a shed for keeping old things.","Quest.stone_4.step2":"As you wish. Although, I know that you don't have anything since the fog took everything away, remeber?","Quest.stone_5.step1":"This is looking great. Whom should I thank for such a great architectural achievement?","Quest.stone_5.step2":"You should thank all of us, your highness. And be sure that we're capable of even greater things.","Quest.stone_6.step1":"We could use it as a watchtower to look after ents and golems so they stay under control.","Quest.stone_6.step2":"For the time being, yes. But since we are planning to have an army of our own we'll need some place where to feed the soldiers... ","Quest.stone_7.step1":"This tavern looks delicious. Should I go in there and test it out?","Quest.stone_7.step2":"Not before we rebuild it and turn into something else.","Quest.stone_8.step1":"How do you like it now?","Quest.stone_8.step2":"You ruined a perfectly nice building but I'll get over it. Eventually. When I eat something.","Quest.stone_10.step1":"This is it. This citadel will mark the beginning of the new Farawake Kingdom. Even stronger and more prosperous one.","Quest.stone_10.step2":"Your spirit and belief is what keeps us going.","Quest.stone_10.step3":"I know that there aren't many of us yet but we can do great things together.","Quest.wagon_1.step1":"Is there anyone in our team who can work with metal?","Quest.wagon_1.step2":"Don't look at me. I've done the most important part already. I rescued you.","Quest.wagon_1.step3":"I don't know if you could tell by my armor but I happen to know a thing or two about alloys.","Quest.wagon_2.step1":"So, what do we do about those beams?","Quest.wagon_2.step2":"They'll make a great foundation for our future buildings. Let's get some more!","Quest.wagon_3.step1":"Are you building an igloo? I didn't know that you were a polar bear...","Quest.wagon_3.step2":"You could've actually learned something if you were using your eyes instead of your mouth more often.  ","Quest.wagon_4.step1":"Grizzly, is this is what I think it is?","Quest.wagon_4.step2":"Yes, sir. I figured that we might need something like this in our situation.","Quest.wagon_4.step3":"What is it? I don't understand.","Quest.wagon_4.step4":"Once again, more watching, less talking.","Quest.wagon_5.step1":"Alright, now I see.","Quest.wagon_5.step2":"I'm curious. What do you see?","Quest.wagon_5.step3":"Okay, you got me. Still no idea.","Quest.wagon_5.step4":"Be patient, my friend. Just help me get more resources and soon you will see everything.","Quest.wagon_6.step1":"You might not know that but Grizzly comes from a very long line of scientists.","Quest.wagon_6.step2":"Really? You don't say. He looks more like a warrior.","Quest.wagon_6.step3":"I'm many things but my heart will always belong to knowledge. I hope that you'll like my new laboratory.","Quest.wagon_7.step1":"This looks nice. What are you planning on doing with it?","Quest.wagon_7.step2":"First off, I got to finish building it so your help will be much appreciated.","Quest.wagon_8.step1":"I got a little hungry from being so overly helpful and I was wondering if there is a way for you to create something tasty and filling in there?","Quest.wagon_8.step2":"Don't mind him. He always talks about food. Is there anything else we can do?","Quest.wagon_8.step3":"It's okay. Thank you. I'll think off something to make when we're done.","Quest.wagon_10.step1":"This is where I'm going to build my laboratory. What do you think?","Quest.wagon_10.step2":"I think it's a great solution. Even if it's not we can always put it somewhere else.","Quest.wagon_10.step3":"Yeah, you can always count on us. We've got your back!","Quest.elf_1.step1":"Are there any hunters among us?","Quest.elf_1.step2":"Why do you ask?","Quest.elf_1.step3":"I've found an arrow.","Quest.elf_1.step4":"It's too early to jump to conclusions. Let's collect some more and see what happens.","Quest.elf_2.step1":"Do you know why we keep coming across these strange things all over the kingdom?","Quest.elf_2.step2":"I can only guess. We need more information if we want tp figure out what happened here. ","Quest.elf_3.step1":"I'm not even sure if anyone here is any good at archery.","Quest.elf_3.step2":"Why would anyone want a bow if you've got an ax?","Quest.elf_3.step3":"Or a hammer?","Quest.elf_3.step4":"I had my share of doubts but now I'm almost certain that this quiver belongs to a more sophisticated being than us.","Quest.elf_4.step1":"What if nobody comes to claim those arrows? Can I keep them then?","Quest.elf_4.step2":"Why do you even want them? They aren't edible.","Quest.elf_4.step3":"I'm going to use them as a big, nice fork.","Quest.elf_5.step1":"The more arrows we find the scarier it becomes.","Quest.elf_5.step2":"And why is that?","Quest.elf_5.step3":"What if their owner decides to use them against us?","Quest.elf_5.step4":"I guess you were also scared when you saw me for the first time. Look at us now. Thick as thieves!","Quest.elf_6.step1":"Pay attention, the owner of the bow can get here any minute.","Quest.elf_6.step2":"We'll make sure to collect more pieces to make the sight more welcoming.","Quest.elf_7.step1":"Does it get any better than this? Who wouldn't want to have such a gorgeous bow?","Quest.elf_7.step2":"What do you know about bows? And, most of all, about beauty? Let's just wait for the owner to reveal herself.","Quest.warlock_1.step1":"Great news! I think I've just found a new recipe. I can finally cook something new.","Quest.warlock_1.step2":"Let me see. Hm... It's not a recipe for a dish. It's a recipe for a potion.","Quest.warlock_1.step3":"I didn't know there were witches allowed into the Farawake Kingdom.","Quest.warlock_1.step4":"Maybe she is not from around here...","Quest.warlock_2.step1":"Can anyone speak ancient languages?","Quest.warlock_2.step2":"No, why do you ask?","Quest.warlock_2.step3":"I've just found the second variable of that magical equation and kind of want to read what's on it.","Quest.warlock_2.step4":"I don't think that it's such a good idea. We wouldn't know what to do with it even if we were proficient in the languages required.","Quest.warlock_3.step1":"How many more spells are out there? Because I keep on finding these books...","Quest.warlock_3.step2":"Does it really matter? We all know that you can't even read them. Leave them be.","Quest.warlock_3.step3":"I'll keep looking till I find something that I can read.","Quest.warlock_4.step1":"I wonder who is the owner of these books. I've never seen anything like it before.","Quest.warlock_4.step2":"That's what we thought when we've found your bow.","Quest.warlock_4.step3":"It's funny how you're always unable to use the things you find.","Quest.warlock_5.step1":"Do you think the owner of these books will have answers?","Quest.warlock_5.step2":"I've been a part of a Royal Guard for many years now and have learned to believe in miracles.","Quest.warlock_5.step3":"Normally I believe in making your own faith but times like this make me wonder if I'm wrong...","Quest.warlock_6.step1":"Grizzly, what do you make of these books from the scientific point of view?","Quest.warlock_6.step2":"I'd rather not say because I don't want to offend anyone.","Quest.warlock_6.step3":"Interesting. Now I'm even more curious to see this so-called witch. ","Quest.warlock_7.step1":"Does anyone want to give up? We've been carrying those books around for too long. And they're not getting lighter.","Quest.warlock_7.step2":"We owe it to their owner to save her. Trust me, I've been there. It's not a nice feeling to be possessed by the fog.","Quest.warlock_8.step1":"The more people we have the better our chances are against the fog.","Quest.warlock_8.step2":"Let's hope that our next reinforcement can shed some light on this mystery.","Quest.magicplant_1.step1":"Look what I've found!","Quest.magicplant_1.step2":"How come you keep on finding things?","Quest.magicplant_1.step3":"It's easy, my friend. I'm just always looking for food.","Quest.magicplant_2.step1":"Do you have any idea what this is?","Quest.magicplant_2.step2":"No, I've never seen anything like it before.","Quest.magicplant_2.step3":"Maybe you can taste it and tell us what it feels like.","Quest.magicplant_2.step4":"I know that I've got a reputation but even I'm scared of eating something so unfamiliar.","Quest.magicplant_3.step1":"I'm so glad that I didn't try and eat it. It started to glow!","Quest.magicplant_3.step2":"It would've been funny to watch your huge belly being lit up on the inside. An oversized human torch, if I may.","Quest.magicplant_4.step1":"So, what should we do about it?","Quest.magicplant_4.step2":"Why are you asking me? I don't know.","Quest.magicplant_4.step3":"Because you're an expert when it comes to trees.","Quest.magicplant_4.step4":"Yes, when it comes to chopping them down. This one looks like it would be wasted on firewood.","Quest.magicplant_5.step1":"It's getting bigger and bigger each time. When does it stop?","Quest.magicplant_5.step2":"I don't know but I bet you that it has plenty of room to grow more.","Quest.magicplant_5.step3":"Alright, but if it doesn't you're cooking tonight.","Quest.magicplant_6.step1":"I have an ingenious idea!  We should read about this plant in the book.","Quest.magicplant_6.step2":"Great plan! Although there is one little problem. None of us can read.","Quest.magicplant_6.step3":"That's right... How could I forget about it!","Quest.magicplant_6.step4":"Not so sharp for a genius, are you?","Quest.magicplant_7.step1":"Wow, look how beautiful it is. Only something good can come out of something as pretty.","Quest.magicplant_7.step2":"Let's find out if you're right!","Quest.magicplant_8.step1":"Am I seeing this right?","Quest.magicplant_8.step2":"No, these flowers aren't for eating.","Quest.magicplant_8.step3":"What are they for then?","Quest.magicplant_8.step4":"I think they're for granting the wishes.","Quest.troll_1.step1":"It looks like your dream is coming true. How do you like your new axe?","Quest.troll_1.step2":"I don't feel like taking someone else's axe. Let's find its actual owner.","Quest.troll_2.step1":"Maybe you will be more compliant and accept my offer of becoming this axe's new master?","Quest.troll_2.step2":"I am pretty happy with my hammer, thank you. Why do you want to get rid of it so much?","Quest.troll_2.step3":"I don't want to starve to death while looking for the one who lost it.","Quest.troll_3.step1":"Did our mutual friend bother you with his offer?","Quest.troll_3.step2":"Of course, he did. But I actually know whose this axe is so I promised to assist with the search.","Quest.troll_3.step3":"Let me know if you need any help!","Quest.troll_4.step1":"Our team is getting bigger. How are you going to feel when you're not the only one who knows his way around axes?","Quest.troll_4.step2":"I'll feel great. There will finally be someone to talk to rather than you.","Quest.troll_5.step1":"It's important to be prepared. We don't know if it's a trap or not. Maybe someone is playing with us.","Quest.troll_5.step2":"I don't sense any dark magic surrounding this axe. I have a reason to believe that we're on the right path.","Quest.troll_5.step3":"I hope you're right but let's keep an eye on each other anyway.","Quest.troll_6.step1":"So, how do you know the axe owner? I thought that archery lovers do not hobnob with others.","Quest.troll_6.step2":"And yet, here I am, talking to you.","Quest.troll_6.step3":"I'm serious. Who is he?","Quest.troll_6.step4":"He is a great hunter. If anyone can help you catch some food for dinner, it's him.","Quest.troll_7.step1":"Look how fancy these axes are! Are you sure you don't want to take one? Who needs two axes?","Quest.troll_7.step2":"Someone who is strong enough to hold both of them.","Quest.troll_8.step1":"I was always wondering, your majesty, what is the weapon of your choice? Could it be an axe by any chance?","Quest.troll_8.step2":"A wise king will do everything in his power to avoid the battle. That's why I always have to keep my brain sharper than any sword.","Quest.troll_9.step1":"Do you still think it's safe? I've never seen an ax that can produce fire.","Quest.troll_9.step2":"It's a very powerful spell but we have nothing to worry about. There is only one sage in all the realms who can cast it.","Quest.troll_9.step3":"And he happens to be a very good friend of the Farawake Kingdom.","Quest.bamboo_1.step1":"I have the greatest of news, Grizzly! There is something that will make your stay here much better. You do like bamboo, right?","Quest.bamboo_1.step2":"I'm sorry to disappoint you but you're confusing me with someone. I'm acquainted with some pandas but I'm not one myself.","Quest.bamboo_1.step3":"Maybe you should learn from them. After all, normal food is always scarce when the Rider is around.","Quest.bamboo_2.step1":"Why do we need this bamboo anyway if Grizzly is not going to eat it?","Quest.bamboo_2.step2":"Don't you remember? I can build anything out of anything. Let's find some more!","Quest.bamboo_3.step1":"Okay, I get that you don't find it tasty but will you consider living in a house made out of bamboo?","Quest.bamboo_3.step2":"Sure, why not. If it's big enough to accommodate me.","Quest.bamboo_3.step3":"Did you hear that? Let's build a mansion for our friend!","Quest.bamboo_4.step1":"I've heard that some warriors use bamboo sticks as their weapons. Are you considering doing the same?","Quest.bamboo_4.step2":"It might be good for combat but I'm more into hunting. So the answer is no.","Quest.bamboo_4.step3":"Got it. Maybe we can build you a shed big enough to store all of your bows and arrows.","Quest.bamboo_5.step1":"I like what you're doing here. The more buildings we have the mightier our forces will be. How many more can you erect?","Quest.bamboo_5.step2":"It depends on how much more materials can we find.","Quest.bamboo_5.step3":"Well, in that case, spare no expense but find what we need. Use all the help you need.","Quest.bamboo_6.step1":"I can't believe I'm saying this but I need you to look for food.","Quest.bamboo_6.step2":"And I can't believe my ears! I'm finally not the only one who is hungry all the time.","Quest.bamboo_6.step3":"Yes, you still are. I was just hoping that you'll accidentally help me find more bamboo while searching for sustenance. ","Quest.bamboo_7.step1":"I don't get it. Why do we use bamboo for construction when we have stone, metal, and wood? Aren't they more resilient?","Quest.bamboo_7.step2":"Yes, they might be. But we don't have a choice. Our lands are spoiled with different kinds of creatures that we have to chop down.","Quest.bamboo_7.step3":"And it would be a waste not to use what's left of them. Everything is valuable when rebuilding our kingdom.","Quest.bamboo_8.step1":"I had no idea that you can erect a building so big and massive using... bamboo.","Quest.bamboo_8.step2":"Well, my friend, when you have enough of something and you know how to use it miracles do happen. Wait until you see the next one!","Quest.bamboo_10.step1":"You weren't lying. This is amazing. I might reconsider relocating here from my current living quarters.","Quest.bamboo_10.step2":"I wouldn't advise you to live in a house that can theoretically be eaten. You might not be a panda but your appetite is unpredictable.","Quest.sapphire_1.step1":"Remember you told me that you can build anything out of anything?","Quest.sapphire_1.step2":"Of course. I don't use words lightly like some other members of our crew.","Quest.sapphire_1.step3":"Then I have a challenge for you if you choose to accept it!","Quest.sapphire_2.step1":"Do you still think that you're up for the task?","Quest.sapphire_2.step2":"I am. And I'll finish faster if you stop talking and start helping me collect more materials.","Quest.sapphire_3.step1":"Doesn't it look fragile to you?","Quest.sapphire_3.step2":"Do not underestimate crystals. The more buildings we have made using them the safer our Kingdom is going to be.","Quest.sapphire_4.step1":"What is it that you're building, guys?","Quest.sapphire_4.step2":"Gingerbeard is desperately trying to prove that he doesn't waste his words.","Quest.sapphire_4.step3":"I'm not trying to prove it. I am actually doing it.","Quest.sapphire_5.step1":"This looks pretty. Although I would never think that you made it.","Quest.sapphire_5.step2":"Why is that?","Quest.sapphire_5.step3":"I don't mean to be rude but you don't look like someone capable of crafting sophisticated buildings like that.","Quest.sapphire_6.step1":"Okay, you've got yourself a deal. I am going to help you under one condition...","Quest.sapphire_6.step2":"I'm doing pretty good on my own. I don't think that I need your help.","Quest.sapphire_6.step3":"It's too late now. I am helping you anyway in exchange for one of these villas. Emeralda seems to like them and I... Hm. I really like her.","Quest.sapphire_7.step1":"Did you tell anyone else about your secret?","Quest.sapphire_7.step2":"No! And if you do I will... I will break your ax into pieces!","Quest.sapphire_7.step3":"Don't worry, it's safe with me. Actually, I find it very romantic. Let's build a real castle for her!","Quest.sapphire_8.step1":"Hey, Grizzly, can you give us a hand? We tried to bite off more than we could chew.","Quest.sapphire_8.step2":"Don't say that you want me to carry materials for you again! I'm a strong and independent bear but I do have feelings too, you know.  ","Quest.sapphire_8.step3":"Of course. And we wouldn't want to hurt them. We're having a tea party with honey and jam afterward and you're invited!","Quest.sapphire_8.step4":"Why didn't you start with that?! What and where do you need me to carry?","Quest.sapphire_9.step1":"So, what are you going to do? Just give her the keys and say \"It's your castle now, enjoy\"?","Quest.sapphire_9.step2":"I didn't think it's through. I'm not good with words, you know that better than anyone.","Quest.sapphire_9.step3":"Maybe we should ask the King? It's his job to be eloquent.","Quest.sapphire_9.step4":"I'm not ready to share my darkest secret with two people in one day. I'll wing it!","Quest.sapphire_11.step1":"How do you like this castle?","Quest.sapphire_11.step2":"It's beautiful. Gingerbeard did a great job.","Quest.sapphire_11.step3":"I've helped him, actually. He said that he couldn't do it without me.","Quest.sapphire_11.step4":"Really? Well, I hope you realize that I was being sarcastic when calling it pretty. My favorite color is green, not purple. Better luck next time."}}
